## ðŸ›  Features

âœ… **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)**
   - Implements different advertisement types (`Anuncio`, `AnuncioFrecuente`, `AnuncioImagen`, etc.)
   - Uses **encapsulation and inheritance** for structured programming.

âœ… **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - The system includes a user interface to manage advertisements.
   - GUI elements are implemented using **Java Swing**.

âœ… **Data Persistence**
   - Advertisement data is stored in **anuncios.dat** and **clientes.dat** files.
   - Uses file handling to **read and write structured data**.

âœ… **Executable JAR**
   - The **main project** can be executed using:
     ```sh
     java -jar main_project/dist/LuisAlonsoCendra-Proyecto-00824.jar
     ```
   - Assignments (`tarea1`, `tarea2`) also contain runnable `.jar` files.

âœ… **Apache Ant Build Automation**
   - Uses `build.xml` for automated compilation and execution.
